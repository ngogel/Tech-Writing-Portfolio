# Vortex Ai1 Smoking Device

## Introduction
Our mission is to provide a discreet yet effective smoking device for those who use marijuana for wellness management, including pain management.

The legalization of marijuana use for pain management has opened the door for many to effectively manage their condition when other therapies have failed. The Vortex Ai1 has been designed to be the practical solution for public and private pain management with its simple, inconspicuous design. Our discreet smoking device features a smokeless bowl, a cubby to store product, as well as a nook to hold a standard lighter.

**Disclaimers**
* This device is intended for marijuana use only.
* Use caution when using this product as its pieces may become hot.

*Speak with your doctor or healthcare provider before beginning any treatment.* Marijuana use should always comply with local, state, and federal laws, rules, and regulations.

## Part Descriptions

**1. Body** - The multi-functional FDA-approved polyethylene body is food grade and mold-resistant. The compartment with cover is to hold and store additional marijuana, and the cubby can hold a standard lighter.

**2. Cubby Screw** - The cubby screw is a standard size screw that can be adjusted with a Phillips head screwdriver.

**3. Pipe** - The detachable low thermal expansion tempered glass tube features a vortex on one side. This allows the smoke to cool, thereby reducing the "burn" of the inhale as traditionally experienced.

**4. Pipe Set Screws** - Two plastic set screws place tension on the pipe in order to keep it secure when in the body. One screw is located on the top of the body and the other is on the bottom of the body. Both set screws can be adjusted with a 1/8" Allen wrench (not included).

**5. Bowl** - The stainless steel bowl comprises a base and a lid that screw together. Together these pieces house the screen and product. The top has a small hole to light the product.

**6. Screen** - The brass screen fits in the bowl in order to hold and filter the product. Your Vortex Ai1 comes with five replacement brass screens.

## Assembly

1. Screw the base of the bowl into the body.

2. Place the brass screen inside the base.

3. Screw the bowl's lid into the base.

4. Insert the vortex side of the pipe into the body's hole that is furthest from the bowl; when inserted, the vortex side of the pipe is closest to the bowl. Adjust the position of the pipe so that it is not blocking the bowl.

5. Use an 1/8" Allen wrench (not included) to adjust the pipe set screws, if necessary.

## Use as Bowl

1. Assemble the device as described in the Assembly section.

2. Unscrew the lid of the bowl and place the product on top of brass screen. Replace top of bowl.

3. Hold the device in your hand while placing a finger of that hand to cover the open hole.

4. Place your mouth on the end of the pipe and, using your free hand, use a lighter to light the top of the bowl while you inhale gently. *Please note: the bowl and the covered hole will be hot.*

5. Once the bowl is lit and the pipe is filled with smoke, cease lighting the bowl as you lift your finger off the hole. Continue to inhale gently using your lungs. When you feel you've inhaled enough, hold in the smoke for as long as feels comfortable. Slowly exhale the smoke.

## Use as One-Hitter

1. Insert the pipe as described in Step 4 of the Assembly section, but allow both sides of the tube to be exposed.

2. Insert the product directly into the vortex-side of the tube. Do not attempt to force product into the vortex.

3. Place the lighter in the cubby with the lighter's wheel pointing down.

4. Place your mouth on the end of the pipe furthest from the lighter.

5. Light the lighter. The flame should be even with the product-end of the tube.

6. Inhale gently until the pipe is filled with smoke, then cease lighting the tube. Continue to inhale gently using your lungs. When you feel you've inhaled enough, hold in the smoke for a moment or for as long as it feels comfortable. Slowly exhale the smoke.

## Cleaning &amp; Care

Remove the lighter and product before cleaning. All parts of this smoking device are dishwasher safe. To clean, disassemble the Vortex Ai1. Screens can be kept in the bowl during cleaning, although we recommend they be washed by hand then dried immediately. Your Vortex Ai1 parts may be placed together in a dishwasher-safe basket.

In order to keep your device working optimally, clean after each use. Ensure all parts are dry before storing. Store all parts of your device in its case. *We recommend hand washing all parts after each use.*

## Quick use as a one-hitter:
